What I Do For Money
=================

I write computer programs.
When bad guys break into a computer,
I help figure out what they did.
I also teach people about programming and math.

I created the 
[Cyber Fire program](https://cyberfire.energy.gov/)
which has been teaching people about all sorts of computer security things
since 2009.

I also run <https://dirtbags.net/>,
which has some free tools I've created to help do the kind of work I do.

I am proud to be employed by
[Pacific Northwest National Laboratory](https://pnnl.gov/).
For 20 years prior, I worked at [Los Alamos National Laboratory](https://lanl.gov/).


What I Do For Fun
===============

I play Irish traditional music,
mostly on Uilleann bagpipes and Low D whistle.
I play with the local trad session,
and also run
the [Los Alamos Slow Session](/slow/),
for people who are interested in learning Irish traditional music,
and prefer a private venue with other learners.

For a few years, I ran an all-girls computer hacking contest
called [Queen Of The Hill](https://qoth.net/).

Years ago,
I helped my county install some bike lanes and start up its bus service.
Politics was very stressful for me, though,
so I stepped away.


Inventions
=========

I'm an inventor, I suppose.
I probably have 40 awful inventions for every 1 good one.

Here are some of the better ones that I didn't do for work:

* [3D printable Uilleann bagpipes](https://git.woozle.org/neale/uilleann/) [work in progress],
  should make it possible to get a good-sounding full set for under $100,
  and you can print it out in a day or two.
  That's about 1/10th the price of the cheapest option currently available.
* MIDI [Irish concertina](https://www.irishconcertinacompany.com/2018/03/goodbye-to-the-term-anglo-concertina) [work in progress],
  is really just a computer keyboard with a twist.
  This will have a built-in tone generator so you can practice with headphones.
* [Wii Rock Band Guitar and Drums](https://git.woozle.org/neale/mockband) 
  lets you 3D print a Rock Band guitar or hack a cheap toy drum into a
  video game controller for playing Rock Band style games,
  including the new (in 2023) "Clone Hero".
* [Vail Internet Morse Code Relay](https://vail.woozle.org/),
  so you can send morse code to your friends without having to
  get a radio license or a bunch of equipment.
* [Morse code key interface](https://git.woozle.org/vail-adapter/) 
  for people who want to connect a morse code key to a computer or smartphone.
* [Hercules DJ Controller driver](https://git.woozle.org/neale/hdjd) for Linux.
  This makes various models of DJ controllers appear as MIDI devices.
  Some of this work was also integrated into the Mixxx DJ interface.
* A [roller derby scoreboard](https://git.woozle.org/neale/hw-rollerderby-scoreboard)
  made out of wood and LEDs. 
  You don't need a computer or projector, and you can see it in direct sunlight.
* [Internet-connected LED matrix](https://git.woozle.org/neale/wallart/) 
  to send fun animations to my family across the country.
* [Podcast player](https://www.printables.com/model/951001-sleep-baseball-podcast-player) 
  for helping us get to sleep. You press the button, it plays a podcast episode.
