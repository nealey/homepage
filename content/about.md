What I Do For Money
=================

I write computer programs.
When bad guys break into a computer,
I help figure out what they did.
I also teach people about programming and math.

I created the 
[Cyber Fire program](https://cyberfire.energy.gov/)
which has been teaching people about all sorts of computer security things
since 2009.

I also run <https://dirtbags.net/>,
which has some free tools I've created to help do the kind of work I do.

I am proud to be employed by
[Pacific Northwest National Laboratory](https://pnnl.gov/).


What I Do For Fun
===============

I play Irish traditional music,
mostly on Uilleann bagpipes and Low D whistle.
I play with the local trad session,
and also run
the [Los Alamos Slow Session](/slow/),
for people who are interested in learning Irish traditional music,
and prefer a private venue with other learners.

I am slowly creating designs for a 3D printable Uilleann bagpipes,
including a new design for 3D printed regulators.
I provide technical support for the
[Axianoff 3d printed Irish Flute](https://www.printables.com/model/1097180-axianov-irish-flute),
and occasionally I'll make one for a friend.

I run the
[Vail Internet Morse Code Relay](https://vail.woozle.org/),
and created the [source code for it](https://git.woozle.org/vail/).
You can use Vail to practice morse code with your friends in private,
or learn what it would be like to send morse code over radio waves,
without having to buy any equipment or obtain a license.
I also designed
[a physical key interface](https://git.woozle.org/vail-adapter/) 
for people who want to connect a morse code key to a computer or smartphone.

When the need arises,
I sometimes make electronic gadgets,
like an [Internet-connected 8x8 LED matrix to send silly animations to my family](https://git.woozle.org/neale/wallart/),
or a [gadget to play a podcast episode to help my wife and I get to sleep when we're busy worrying](https://www.printables.com/model/951001-sleep-baseball-podcast-player).

For a few years, I ran an all-girls computer hacking contest
called [Queen Of The Hill](https://qoth.net/).

Years ago,
I helped my county install some bike lanes and start up its bus service.
Politics was very stressful for me, though,
so I stepped away.
