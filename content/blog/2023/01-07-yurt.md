One day,
back in the late 1990s,
I discovered that the content filter appliance at work
had blocked woozle.org
for hosting porn.

Because I worked in the group that ran that filter,
I looked into what triggered this block.
I was pretty sure I didn't have any porn.

The offending image was called `yurt.png`.
It was a cartoon drawing of a yurt.
I told the filter it was a "false positive":
it wasn't actually porn.
That got the entire site unblocked.

I don't know why I put that image on my web server,
but the yurt has stayed on woozle.org ever since.
