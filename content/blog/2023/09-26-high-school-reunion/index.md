A few people from high school keep reaching out to me,
year after year,
asking if I'm going to the reunion this year.

I am not.

I like the person I am now!
I acknowledge that high school me and college me were necessary steps toward adult me,
but stepping into my high school shoes again is not an appealing proposition.

I understand that this calculation is different for everyone.
But 
I personally have little to gain from going to the reunion.
