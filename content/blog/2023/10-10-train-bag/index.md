I like to carry the things I need easy access to in a train bag.
I hook this over the leg rest lever,
and then I can just kinda chill and not need to get to my backpack at all.

Here's what's in my bag:

* Extension cord
* USB Power Supply & Battery
* Two USB C charging cables
* One USB Micro charging cable
* E-book reader
* Earbuds
* Sleepin' earbuds
* Thing I cram in my nose to keep me from snoring as much
* Practice bagpipe and wired earbuds
* Nintendo Switch if I brought that
* Resistance band for getting the ol' muscles moving
* Maybe a pair of reading glasses
* Whatever other non-food junk I feel like I might want

I typically leave that bag there for the entire trip.
If I head into the observation car, I can bring the bag with me,
and it's got my book and glasses and charger.

When it's time to deboard,
I can grab the train bag,
cram it into the backpack,
and I'm all set.
