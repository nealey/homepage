I am having trouble delivering mail to work from woozle.org,
despite going through Gmail.

I suspect at some point I'm going to have to tell everybody to give up on their
@woozle.org email addresses,
because email is not something you can get without throwing yourself at the mercy of a gigantic tech company.

This blog post is really an excuse to bookmark somebody else's blog post,
about the same problem,
because I keep needing to refer to it:
