title: App List
---

This is most of the apps I use on my smartphone.

* 1Password: I'll have to rely on the browser version
* A Better Route Planner: The new phone has some version of Google Maps,
  and longer trips can be planned on the computer beforehand
* *Amtrak*: this one could be tough. Having the Amtrak app is very helpful
  on train voyages when problems happen.
* Andronome: A metronome app. I bet I can make a web app on woozle.org to do this.
* AntennaPod: Podcasts. I think there's a podcast app for KaiOS.
* Authenticator: There's a TOTP app for KaiOS. I may need to update it.
* Awful: I'll use the web version.
* Book Reader: I wasn't reading books on the phone. What's funny is that
  I read Moby Dick on my Nokia 5310. But the smartphone is too distracting to read.
* Calculator: KaiOS has a calculator.
* ChargePoint: EV charger app. I may have to either pay more and use my credit card,
  or get their plastic card for in-network rates.
* ConnectBot: ssh client. There's one on my laptop.
* Contacts: There's one built into KaiOS.
* Electrify America: same story as ChargePoint.
* EVGo: same story.
* Firefox: KaiOS has a browser. I bet it's awful. But I don't think I'll use it much.
* Fitbit: Gonna have to give this one up.
* Gmail: I'm already off gmail.
* *Google Calendar*: This may be the thing that pulls me back.
  Getting push reminders of upcoming events has been a big deal.
* Google Home: I think I actually need to keep the phone just for this app.
* Google Messages: It'll be SMS only for me.
* Google News: good riddance.
* Google Photos: web version.
* Google Podcasts: they're killing this anyway.
* Google Pay: credit cards have tap to pay.
* Listen Audiobook Player: I'll have to see if I can find a KaiOS app for this.
* Mattermost: No more work push notifications for me, so sad.
* Open Camera: The camera is not as big a part of my life now as it once was.
  I can get snapshots with the dumbphone. Not good ones, but good enough.
  I grew up with crummy 110 cameras. It'll be okay.
* Plex: maybe I can copy video files over, for the train trips.
  Will I want to watch movies on a 2-inch screen, though?
  Good thing I have a laptop!
* PlexAmp: I will have to copy music files over to my phone, like I did 20 years ago.
  It'll be okay.
* Proton Mail: laptop ahoy!
* *Signal*: Ironically, Signal is the one app that absolutely cannot run without a smartphone.
  And it's where most of my friends are.
* gStrings: (instrument tuner) I may have to buy a guitar tuner!
* YouTube: comes with the phone, although, again, 2-inch screen.
* YouTube Music: same story as PlexAmp. Music files on phone.
* Work Apps: I'll just use my work laptop for work. It'll be fine,
  the main inconvenience will be when I forget to do my timecard,
  I'll have to grab the laptop.
* Banking Apps: they all have web sites I can use,
  although one of my credit cards leans fairly heavily into the app.
