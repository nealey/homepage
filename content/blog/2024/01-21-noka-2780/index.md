I've been using a Nokia 2780 flip phone instead of my Pixel 6 smartphone.
Here are my notes about it.

# Good

* Smaller than my smartphone in most dimensions (but thicker) - easily fits into pockets
* Battery lasts multiple days
* Plays music
* Group SMS support
* Calendar with reminders
* FM Radio
* Connects to WiFi
* Call quality is excellent
* Can act as hotspot
* Modern web browser with JavaScript
* Email client
* Basic calculator
* Conversation starter: nearly everyone who sees it wants to tell me about 
    a fond memory of a featurephone they once used


# So-so

* Camera works fine
* Group SMS displays a blank subject before every message
* Google Maps
    * It works!
    * It tracks your position on the map
    * You have to manually move to the next leg of each trip
    * No "location sharing", people can't see where you are, and you can't see where they are
* Google Calendar Sync
* QR Code Reader in store (has ads)
* Podcast app in store (has ads)
* MMS (group texts, or photos) can take a few minutes to arrive when the phone is closed.
    This may be a power saving issue.


# Bad

* Headphone jack doesn't detect speakers, only headphones
* No way to automatically mute sounds during "quiet hours" (like, when you are asleep)
* Predictive text input guesses one 4 means "g", not "I"
* Will not play FLAC files
