Trip Report!

It's been just over a week with the 2780. It's... fine, actually. I thought I was going to sorely miss a couple of things, but I just don't. It only took a couple days to adjust to not having a computer nearby all the time. All the articles I read about "I tried going without a smartphone for a month: here's what happened" are like, breathlessly claiming something or the other, but for me, it's just been meh. It's fine, whatever.

Ms Cruft got a Light Phone 2 a few days ago and she's having a bit of an adjustment. Last night she put it on silent, and then woke up complaining that it really worried her that Cruft Jr might have called in the middle of the night, and she missed the call. We eventually decided she could just turn the phone down and ignore text messages.

I am getting a lot of text messages at night. I hadn't realized how often that happened. Jr sends things after we're asleep, but the biggest offender is my 84 year old father, who likes to stay up until 2am working on projects and send me updates about everything before he turns in. Allowing myself to ignore the messages seems to work okay, but I do wish it had auto quiet hours with the "call twice and you ring through" thing that Android has.

Anyway. The Light Phone 2 has maps that are maybe a touch nicer than Google Maps on the 2780, but also chew through CPU. Ms Cruft had to hard reset her phone because it stopped being responsive to inputs, it was spending all its power rendering map frames on the e-ink display. The text input is nicer on the Light Phone because it supports diacriticals (like ñ and ç and ø), handy if you use Latin-based languages other than English.  It also has a more polished Podcast and Music player than the Nokia. It does not have a camera. It does play to wired speakers. It does not appear to sync SMS to the car.

Since we embarked on this silly thing for Jr, I've been thinking about which one would work better for a college student, and I think it's the 2780. Here's my breakdown of thinking:

[b]You'll prefer the Nokia 2780 if[/b]
[list]
[*] You want SMS in your car
[*] You want a camera
[/list]

[b]The Light Phone 2 is the way to go if[/b]
[list]
[*] Size is a primaryn concern
[*] You aren't willing to put up with ads
[*] You do a lot of texting
[/list]
