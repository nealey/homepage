I'm still using the Light Phone 2.

They got rid of the percent button on the calculator,
which was bonkers and didn't work like any other calculator's percent button.
I know how to multiply by 1.20, so I wasn't using it anyway.

My wife has one coming in a few days.
She got us both these Lemur leather cases,
which hold a few cards.
I put my driver license,
a printout of my medical insurance card,
the Tesla key (which is an RFID card),
and a credit card in mine;
I no longer carry a wallet.

It crashes sometimes: I reboot it.
One time the voicemail icon was stuck on
until I had someone else leave me a voicemail:
once I deleted that, the indicator went away.

Mostly it's just a low-drama thing I carry around to get phone calls
and calendar alerts.
I also use it to listen to podcasts on my bluetooth earbuds
when I'm walking the dog home from dropping
my wife off at work.
But mainly, I don't think about it at all,
which is nice.

Jr has given up on the Nokia, I think.
It would get stuck trying to receive text messages once in a while,
and need the SIM card put into an Android phone to get everything moving again.

The fact that no Nokia 2780 reviews mention this makes me think the reviewers use the phone for a couple days,
write the review,
and then stop using it.
That's a shame.
