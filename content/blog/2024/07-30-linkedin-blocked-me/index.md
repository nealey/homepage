LinkedIn has blocked me.

I hope I don't sound too much like a crackpot by stating that I'm not
comfortable "submitting a government-issued ID" to Microsoft.
I presume they really mean "submit a photograph of a government-issued ID",
but still.

LinkedIn was the only social media network I ever joined,
and days after doing so,
I regretted it.
Other people have good write-ups of why it's problematic.
For me, the short version of the story is that
it was a lot of dumb stuff I wasn't interested in.

I remember trying to get a certification in the Go language.
They asked me about all kinds of compile-time flags on Windows
that I had never used, since I was doing all my development on Unix.
I failed the certification attempt,
which is okay,
because I could continue to write Go programs without it.

Anyway,
my LinkedIn account is now frozen in whatever state I last left it.
If you send me messages there,
I won't get them.
I probably wouldn't have gotten them anyway,
since my messages were mostly recruiter spam.
I think I linked to woozle.org from it,
but I can't even pull up my own profile without logging in,
and I can't log in until I let the drop my driver license or passport in whatever database they run.

I 5-10 years everybody will hate LinkedIn anyway,
so I guess I'm just ahead of my time :)
