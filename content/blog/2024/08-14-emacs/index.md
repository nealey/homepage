I'm back on Emacs.

Somebody on the Something Awful Forums pointed out that VSCode will only be cool
for as long as Microsoft cares about it.
Given the recent banning of my LinkedIn account,
I figured it was time to go back to Emacs.

Emacs 29 really did make a lot of improvements.

I picked it back up almost instantly,
and I've already learned some new things.
I thought I would miss multi-cursor,
so I installed an emacs thing to do it,
but I'm using the built-in search/replace mechanisms more.

It has a package system now!
And they introduced a related thing that makes my ~/.emacs/init.el
pretty neat and tidy.

Eshell is still pretty great,
I've been using that quite a bit.
And they've got this new treesitter stuff that works great in Go,
is a little crashy in JavaScript.
I'm expecting a big improvement in Emacs 30.

This is all in Windows most of the time,
although I'm using it in Linux too.

Anyway, I'm back on Emacs now.
I think I'm probably done trying out new editors.
