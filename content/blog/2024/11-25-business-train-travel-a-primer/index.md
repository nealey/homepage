# Advantages

Lower Cost
: Rail travel tends to cost less than air.
  As I write this, a weekend trip from Pasco to Chicago,
  two months from now,
  costs $256 on Amtrak.
  The least expensive flight is $306.

Within Travel Policy
: Because costs are usually lower,
  train travel can be easily booked and reimbursed.
  You just need to obtain an airfare quote for an equivalent flight.
  In fact, section 8.4.3 of the PNNL Travel Policy Manual states that
  "railroad travel should be used when appropriate".

More Comfortable
: A coach seat on Amtrak is larger and more configurable
  than a first class seat on American
  (the only airline I've ever flown first class).

Productive Work Environment
: The train provides a quiet and dedicated space for work.
  A power outlet is available for every seat,
  a generous tray is available for your laptop,
  and the unhurried nature of rail travel
  provides the opportunity for focus.
  
Delays Provide Tourism Opportunities
: Travel delays happen no matter what.
  But because train stations have more lax security,
  and are located downtown,
  it's easy to walk outside the station and find interesting things to do when delayed.

More Energy Efficient
: According to the
  [2022 US Department of Energy Data Book](https://tedb.ornl.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/TEDB_Ed_40.pdf#page=50), 
  Amtrak is 33% more energy efficient than domestic air travel.
  This can be an important consideration as PNNL persues its
  NZERO initiative scope 3 goals.


# Disadvantages

Travel time is longer
: Sometimes travel time can be hours or even days longer.
  PNNL allows you to use personal days at the beginning and end of your trip,
  and your manager may even allow you to bill work while on the train.
  Because you can sleep on the train,
  there's no additional hotel expense for the extra personal days.
  And packing your own food is allowed,
  so you can handle the lack of per diem on personal days.

Delays can be very long
: On some multi-leg trips,
  there is only one train per day.
  This means a delay can cause you to miss a connection.
  While Amtrak will board you for the night and provide you meal money,
  it's wise to have a "buffer day" at your destination that you can afford to miss.

Increased up-front complexity
: The "Advanced Travel Request" step of PNNL's travel procedure
  requires you to know what personal days you will take
  before a travel agent establishes an itinerary.
  This means you must work out the train schedule on your own,
  without the help of the travel agency.
  *note: maybe it doesn't need to be this hard, I'm still investigating options*
