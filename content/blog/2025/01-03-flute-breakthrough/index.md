Today I made a major breakthrough on my flute.
This 3D printed flute is actually a lovely instrument,
with a nice tone, and a robust low D.
I just wasn't playing it correctly.

The thing I was missing was placing the flute under my lower teeth.
I had been cramming it up into my lower teeth instead of resting it against my chin.
Somehow this meant that the low D was very weak:
I was overblowing it into the next octave every time I tried to play it.
Now that I've sorted this out,
I can nail the D every time.

Curiously, what I did immediately before this
was to rotate the flute head a full quarter-circle toward me,
so that the embouchure was about even with my left thumb.
This allowed me to blow straight forward into the flute,
using the side-of-mouth muscles I used to play oboe.
Once I was convinced it was possible to make a nice low D this way,
I was able to rotate it back and get it the traditional way.

Maybe there was more to figuring this out than I realized.
But in any case, I can play two full octaves reliably now,
which should help quite a bit in my progress.
Thank heavens!
