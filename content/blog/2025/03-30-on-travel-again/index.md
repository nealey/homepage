I'm on travel again, this time by airplane. 
I've decided that actually air travel sucks. 
You get the absolute minimum amount of space required
to store a human without too much complaining,
and you just... sit there,
waiting for the plane to land.
At some point you get a plastic cup of juice and 24 tiny pretzels.

I'm concerned that this may be the end of train travel for me.
The current presedential administration just forced out the CEO of Amtrak,
and keeps talking about privatizing passenger rail in the US.
That would probably mean the end of service to anywhere east of the Mississippi river,
except inside of California.

My backpack was only 3/4 full this time:
I was surprised that it was so light!
I think it's a combination of the compression provided by the pillow/clothes bag I made after my last trip,
warmer weather,
and the recent realization that I was still overpacking clothes.
I do laundry every day,
so 3 outfits gives me one to dry, one to wear, and one for emergencies.
Combined with a couple long-sleeve shirts and a jacket,
I've got 12 different outfit combinations.

It also helps that I didn't pack much food for a 90-minute flight ;)
