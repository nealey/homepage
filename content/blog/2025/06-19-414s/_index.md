In 1983, some boy scouts hacked into some computers owned by Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL).

As part of my effort to provide cybersecurity education,
I was able to direct some funding in 2017 to Alex Malin,
who hunted down whatever information he could find about it.
That information was released to the public,
in what LANL calls an "unlimited release".
That release means I can publish it here,
so I am doing that.

I hope this is useful to somebody!
