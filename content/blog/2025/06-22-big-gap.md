title: Why there's a big gap in my blog

The reason there's a big gap in my blog between 2015 and 2021
is because of the rise of social media.
All these neat new things popped up that lured me away from writing my clunky old blog:
I think Google+ was a big part of this.
It was so easy to make quick posts,
and attach images.
Everybody I knew was doing it,
and I didn't want to feel socially isolated
[DRAMATIC FORESHADOWING]
so I stopped updating the blog.

Now that Google+ is long gone,
I've lost everything I ever wrote there.
I don't know if Google has it or not;
I'm sure I couldn't get to it if they did.

I'm updating my blog again now, in 2025.
Humanity is beginning to realize that
looking into a screen when there are living people right next to you
is causing social isolation,
and people are beginning to move away from social media.

My blog entries are longer, and less frequent, than social media posts.
Because the system is a little more clunky,
I have to stop and consider whether there's something I want to take the time to write multiple
paragraphs about.
Also, I get to keep everything I write,
so you can go as far back as 2004 to see what I was thinking was important to tell the world.

But you'll miss 2015 to 2021, which is gone forever.
When I tell people we are living in a dark age,
this is what I'm talking about.
