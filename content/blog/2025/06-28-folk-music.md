Our local folk music session recently had an email list discussion
about this rumored DropBox folder containing sheet music for
everything. Somebody replied saying, essentially, this isn't their
folder and it's doubtful the copyright terms allow us to give it away
anyhow. Here's what I wrote back, then removed because it was too long:

I'm going to guess whatever's in this DropBox folder probably has
multiple authors, and that the vast majority don't list any
copyright information at all, much less distribution
terms. Unfortunately, that means we can't make copies. Even having
them in the DropBox is probably not legal.

Sifting through the documents looking for things that clearly show
who holds the copyright, and indicating that the copyright holder
grants distribution permissions, would be a big job. I have a hunch
it would only yield a few documents: probably less than a dozen.

If we wanted our own Folk Music Fake Book, we would probably have to
start over, accurately notating every tune we play, and building
sets out of those tunes: essentially, recreating thesession.org from
scratch. We'd need some sort of contributor agreement, either a
shrink-wrap license or a signed document, agreeing to place all
contributions into some variant of a creative commons license. Just
getting 12 people to agree on distribution terms for creative work
is a pretty big effort, to say nothing of actually notating all the
tunes. It could take years.

Another option would be me bringing my little tape recorder in, and
trying to cajole some sort of AI engine to transcribe tunes from the
recording. This would have to be proofread and edited, but it might
only take a year of weekends before a finished product was ready.

My hot take: it's not worth it. Lots of this music is so old, it
predates the Gutenberg press and any notion of copyright. It gets
passed along aurally, and all the quirky variations are a result of
people remembering things just a bit differently. That's a very human
tradition and what makes folk music special.
