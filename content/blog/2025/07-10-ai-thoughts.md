I've been using an AI coding assistant this week. Here are some things I've noticed.

I have trouble keeping up with it
-------------------------

It's writing code so quickly, and spewing its thought processes at me
so fast, that I can't really keep up. I very quickly learned to give
up reading its thoughts, and instead focus on the code, using its
thought process only to clarify my understanding of the code it creates.

It doesn't feel like writing my own code anymore
-----------------------

It feels more like I'm fixing somebody else's code.

I no longer have a complete knowledge of how everything fits together,
and only a tenuous grasp on the overall architecture.
I can focus in on areas where I see improvements need to happen,
but it doesn't feel like I'm working on my own creation here.

It forces a certain development model
---------------------------

It makes top-down development difficult:
when I have an idea about a thing I want to add,
I'll usually add the code to call the thing first,
and then go add the new thing.

The AI gets pretty confused by this
