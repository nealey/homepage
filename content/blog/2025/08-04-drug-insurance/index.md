I'm taking this new asthma medication.
It's life-changing: I haven't needed my resue inhaler once in months,
and I didn't realize how much easier it could be to play the flute.

I take one inhalation per day, 
and there are 30 doses in an inhaler.
So I essentially need one per month.
I wish I could get a refill, 
and not have to throw away the plastic case,
but this is the world I live in.
It's taken a bit under two months but under my doctor's advice,
I've discovered that taking it in the evening mostly avoids the hoarseness
associated with the drug.
We also decided I should try taking it once every other day,
to see if that help on weeks when I'm teaching and need to talk a lot.
I'm at a steady state now, and I'm enjoying 
all this low-effort breathing.

{{< figure src="breo.jpg" alt="A Breo Ellipta Inhaler" class="thumbnail" caption="the second inhaler cost $80. It had the same lot number as the first one." >}}

The pharmacy couldn't tell me why the price had gone up 800%.
I called the insurance company, 
and they said the first inhaler had been a generic,
so I should switch my prescription to their mail-order service
and they'd be able to get me the cheaper generic every time.

{{% aside %}}

The "authorized generic" in this case appears to be related to the
delivery device (inhaler) still being under patent. By selling an
"authorized generic" through a third party, the drug manufacturer is
hoping to lower the cost of the drug just enough to discourage other
companies developing a competing generic.

It's a weird outcome that results from a complex system of negotiated
prices, rebates, discounts, and more, related to the original drug's
branding. The end result is higher prices for consumers, and it would
be easy to blame drug companies for this, but it's a result of the
entire extant system.

{{% /aside %}}

Something called an "authorized generic" does exist.
I had no reason to doubt any of this.
I asked my provider to resubmit the prespcription to their mail-order service,
and please request a generic.

I just logged into their prescription service and saw I'd been billed
$160 for three inhalers. The doctor had mentioned they like to send
you 3 for the price of 2, so I assume they're still billing me $80 per
inhaler. That's an improvement, but the $10 inhaler they promised
would have been nice, so I opened a chat window.

I like to be cordial and friendly when I'm talking to support people.
Typically they're just doing their best with a big unwieldy system,
and may not completely understand what's happening, even though
they're representing the whole company.  So I did my best to be
friendly and understanding for 2 hours as I was passed between three
people. Here's what I learned along the way:

## Web Site

The insurance company web site says I can get an authorized generic
"Fluticasone Furoate/Vilanterol Ellipta" at $20 for a 90-day supply (3
inhalers).

It also claims I can get one at my local pharmacy for $10, which the
pharmacy told me wasn't true. Or maybe it was true, and I just had to
use the magic word "generic". Or maybe some other explanation about
how I got it for $10 once.

## First Person

I can get a drug called "Wexela" at $10 for a 30-day inhaler,
or $20 for three of them. 
This is a slightly different drug: Fluticasone / Salmeterol.
It's is supposed to be taken twice a day instead of the once a day I have currently.
This would be the low-effort way to get the drug I need at a low cost,
but taking it twice a day means I would more or less lose my voice.
I know because I've tried it in the past.

It sounded like I needed to cancel the $160 90-day shipment going out
the door and ask for another prescription for Wexela. 
Before I authorized stopping the shipment, 
I asked why I couldn't get the authorized generic the web site said I could get,
and they transfered me to a pharmacist.

## The Pharmacist

The pharmacist was able to tell their system "pretend it's November,
how much with the authorized generic cost?" The answer was "this isn't
covered by this insurance plan".

He also mentioned that he had no idea how I'd gotten the drug for $10 initially.
It seemed to him that the $10 price was a mistake.

I said I'd like to cancel the $160 order,
and was told it was too late,
it had already shipped.
I was transferred to a supervisor to see if I could send it back.

It's important to note that nobody ever asked if they could fill this.
I suppose we waived away the right to authorize filling prescriptions
when we signed up for the mail-order service.
But it was beginning to feel like a big oppressive system working its hardest
to charge me $160 for $20 worth of medicine.

## Third person

The third person took a while to read back over everything,
and eventually came back offering me a one-time $130 credit,
and said they'd found someplace I could get the drug for $10 a month.

As I usually do, I repeated my understanding of what they were saying.
They confirmed that I understood correctly. So I said yes,
I would be willing to pay $30 for the three-month supply already in the mail,
and I would love to know where I could get it for $10 a month.

The web site then decided I needed to be logged out, and killed the chat.

## Fourth person

I logged back in and opened another chat.
I explained where I had left off, and
the fourth person quickly escalated to a supervisor.

## Fifth person

The supervisor said they'd get back to me on whether I could get that credit I was offered.
They also said they'd get back to me on whether I could send the drugs back.
I shouldn't open the package when it arrived.

They confirmed that if I didn't hear back before I ran out of medicine,
I should call them again.

# Where Thing Stand

This took about 2½ hours,
and I feel like my polite approach actually sped things up quite a bit.
I wish I had not needed to start over when the web site logged me out;
I could have been done in just under 2 hours that way.

I am not expecting to actually hear back from them before I run out of medicine.
While this company has not yet acted in a way to make me distrust them,
other interactions with support at large companies has.
It's not difficult to imagine the supervisors hove a number of cases that must be resolved per week:
the first one invented the credit to end the interaction quickly,
and the second one invented the review for the same purpose.
The people doing these jobs have metrics they must meet,
and it would be typical of these types of jobs if the number of cases closed per week
is a more important metric than helping customers.

Because I got no notification that any review had been opened,
I sent a follow-up message regarding this review.
I'm hoping a different person will read my message and let me know there is no such thing,
so I can start this 2½ hour process again before I run out of medicine.

When the medicine arrives in the mail,
I can either pay $160 for it,
or spend more time with support trying to send it back for a refund,
so I can get the $20 medicine they said I would get 
if I followed the instructions they gave when I called them initially.

This is an awful situation for someone who can't afford this kind of rigamarole.
$20 every 3 months works out to $80 a year;
$160 every 3 months works out to $640 a year.
That's eight times the price.
And people with low-paying jobs typically don't have 2½ to spend
with an insurance company trying to figure out how to get the $20 that was offered.

# The Failures

I think there were a number of failures here:

## The initial failures

This happened when I went to get my prescription refilled at the local pharmacy.

* My local pharmacy, for some reason, charged me $10 when they should
  have charged me $80
* Whatever caused the $10 price didn't happen when I went to fill the
  second time
* The person at my local pharmacy has no idea how prices are set at
  the pharmacy, and suggested I call the insurance company

## Round 2 of failures

This happened when I called the insurance company.

* The insurance company also has no idea how prices are set
* Alice, the teir 1 support person at the insurance company, had to guess what
  was going on, and guessed the initial price difference was due to a
  generic drug being filled the first time
* I constructed a story where a generic would be filled at $10 where
  the brand name was $80
* When I asked Alice if the generic situation would be handled better
  if I switched the prescription to their in-house mail-order service,
  she agreed with me, without knowing if it was actually true
* My healthcare provider bought my constructed story about the generic

## Round 3 of failures

These all happened today.

* The insurance company isn't actually involved in the pricing quoted
  by my local pharmacy, and has no insight into how the local pharmacy
  sets prices
* The local pharmacy is telling the insurance company the drug is $10,
  which the insurance company web site is relaying to me
* The various support people I talked to this morning may have been
  under pressure to move on to the next support case, resulting in
  them inventing solutions (refund, review process) they thought would
  placate me

# Analysis

In computing we would call this a "federated" system, where everything
is its own island and there's a complex patchwork to try and get it
all talking back and forth.  It falls down a lot.

In this situation, a reasonable patient might think there's some
golden ring ($10 medicine) that somebody somewhere is keeping away
from them. Really it's just that the system failed in a way that
presents the illusion of the ring. Having actually obtained it once is
absolutely not conducive in anybody buying any explanation other than
"this is possible and you just need to figure out how to repeat it".

Since we can afford it, I'll probably just eat the cost whether I get
this credit or not. But, man, I can really feel for people scraping to
make ends meet. I didn't authorize this $160 charge, it just showed up,
after I was promised it would be $20.

You shouldn't need 30 years experience with complex systems to
understand this.
