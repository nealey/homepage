I've read a few things recently bemoaning how wasteful it is that
people keep saying thank you to the AI. I do this, and I'm not going
to stop. Here's why:

1. This technology was built to interact with humans
2. I am a human
3. I want to be in the habit of showing gratitude
4. This technology better serves my desire to show gratitude when I thank it

That's all there is to it!
