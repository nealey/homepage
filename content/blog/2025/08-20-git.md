I've reached my wit's end with web crawlers taking 100% of my CPU to download absolutely everything
from forgejo.
`robots.txt` isn't honored by these things.

I'm rolling out a <a href="https://pgit.pico.sh/">static site generator for git</a>.
It's my hope that by providing a glimpse of the code to web crawlers,
and the ability to <code>git clone</code> the entire repo,
I can get a nice snappy site again,
which serves everybody:

Humans
: will have the ability to quickly peruse the code,
  and the ability to download it if they want more.

Web Crawlers
: will be able to fetch a couple versions of all the files,
  for whatever use they have in mind.

Code Contributors
: will be able to push commits over SSH.

Hopefully I can get this all going in the next few weeks.
