Blog is short for "web log".
It's a sort of online journal,
that anyone who finds it can read.

Mostly when I write here,
I'm thinking the reader will either be someone looking me up online who wants to know more about me,
or someone in the future who wants to know what life was like during my time.

I don't have a lot of personal anecdotes,
or commentary on current events.
Mostly this is just hobbies and idle thoughts.
