title: Neale's Blog

Blog is short for "web log":
a public online journal.

The audience I have in mind is usually:

1. People living in the future (my descendants)
2. People alive right now who need help with something I know a lot about
3. Friends and family

I don't have a lot of personal anecdotes,
or commentary on current events.
Mostly this is just hobbies and idle thoughts.
