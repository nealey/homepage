Blog is short for "web log":
a public online journal.

The audience I have in mind is usually:

1. People living in the future (my descendants)
2. People alive right now who need help with something I know a lot about
3. Friends and family

Main topics I write about include:

Technology and Computing
: hands-on projects, software development, in-depth discussions on operating systems,
  network configurations, cybersecurity, and the societal impact of technology.

Music & Musical Instruments
: learning music, musical instrument design and construction, and
  maintenance of musical instruments; with a heavy emphasis on Irish
  traditional music like [Uilleann bagpipes](/tags/bagpipes/),
  [flutes](/tags/flute/), and [whistles](/tags/whistle/).

Travel & Sustainability
: business and personal travel, how to pack light, and my efforts to
  reduce carbon emissions through taking [trains](/tags/trains/) whenever I can.

In-Depth Analysis & Investigations
: Applying my knowledge and skills to analysis of various topics and events,
  including the [CLRG cheating scandal](/tags/clrg/).
  
Old TV shows
: I have an on-again, off-again history of summarizing episodes of
  [Doctor Who](/tags/drwho/) and [The Love Boat](/tags/loveboat/).

I try to avoid politics and other headline-type issues,
although I'm happy to dive into hot-button issues where I can provide expert analysis.
Otherwise, this is mostly hobbies and idle thoughts.
