title: All of Doctor Who
---

I'm going to try to watch every episode of Doctor Who, in order.
Then I'm going to write up what I think.

A few rules I'm setting out initially:

* It's okay to skip an episode if I just can't handle it.
* I don't have to write a big ol' treatise on each one.
* I fully understand I lack cultural and temporal context for a lot of this,
  and I'm not going to feel bound to try and attain said.
* I will be viewing this though my personal biases.
* I may create more rules later on.
