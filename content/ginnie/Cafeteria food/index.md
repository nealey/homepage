Steps:
1. Go to cafeteria
2. Rice is better than pizza in every way
3. Sometimes they don't make rice so you settle for pizza
4. Salad bar
5. Pick your poison

Review:
6/10.
Usually while I eat my boring cafeteria salads, I have more important things to think about. I don't mind it. As my boyfriend knows and puts up with, I like to eat everything separately, so since it's a random assortment I don't know why I combine the vegetables. Saving space? At the point of organising my food, though, I come off crazy and can't even call it a salad.
