Steps:
1. Go to Co-Op
2. Go to Vegetarian Kitchen section
3. Find this "Greek" salad
4. Mix it up

Review:
4/10.
Could use some work. Cheese included. Dry falafels. Okay for road trips when you can't find anything else...but, then again, you went to the Co-Op - why didn't you find something better while you were there?
