My Go-To

![Lettuce, avocado, corn, veggies, sour cream](image-2.png)

Steps:
1. Go to Gabriel's
2. They are closed on Tuesdays
3. "Veggie taco salad please"
4. Might come with sour cream
5. Put the taco between the fork sprungs and twist it

Review:
9/10.
I have this every time, mostly because it's the only thing I can eat here. But also it's bitchin'. Very big, though.
