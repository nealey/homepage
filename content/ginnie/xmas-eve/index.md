![Spinach, tomatoes, artichokes, and olives in a bowl](image.png)

Steps:
1. Big bowl
2. Fill it up with spinach (it will pack down later)
3. Whole can of artichokes
4. A couple olives
5. Some cherry tomatoes
6. An amount of balsamic vinegar
7. Stir it if you want

Review:
5/10.
Big puddle of balsamic vinegar and artichoke juice at the bottom. Started sweet and simple, made my parents jealous, ended kinda bored. Filling enough.
