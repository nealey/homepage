title: Making "Monopoly" suck less

These are simple alternative rules for Monopoly which make the game
more balanced and, as a result, more exciting and less hurtful.  No
longer does every player know who will win after a few passes of "Go":
it's anybody's game right up to the end.  Strategy becomes more
important than luck.

Rules to make Monopoly more fun
-------------------------------

1. Anyone who owns a property can begin building on it without needing
   a Monopoly.
2. To build, you must pay the money to the bank, and then roll above
   8 on the dice.

Granted this takes the monopoly aspect out of "Monopoly", but who
cares if it allows you to again enjoy the board game you purchased?

Questions I've been asked
-------------------------

* Can you hand over property that's built on?

  It's up to you.  Since there's no rent advantage to obtaining a
  monopoly (unless there are no houses on a property, in which case
  rent doubles), there's much less incintive to engage in the sorts of
  unbalanced trades one typically finds oneself making to stay in the
  game.
