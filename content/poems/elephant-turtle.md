It's a really difficult thing to search for,
but as far as I can tell,
this is the first ever rhyming emoji poem.

I would of course love to be proven wrong about this,
so if you find a prior example,
please let me know about it,
and I'll link to it or reference it here!

If this is indeed the first,
then [this follow-up post](https://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3960167#post512735911)
would be the first emoji limerick.
