title: Sap

I love you dear, so very much  
That I get sappy when we touch  
Or even when I think of you  
Your eyes so red, your hair so blue  

I see your face, it warms my heart  
It makes my colon leap, then fart  
There aren't enough words to express how much I am in love with you  
Even breaking meter won't do

The fleshy folds around your teeth  
Are red like blood, beyond belief  
They make me want to osculate  
And doing so is super-great

In short, my love, you fill my gap  
With sticky, drippy, sugary sap  
I hope you're with me for all time  
And that is why I wrote these lines
