When
: To Be Determined

Where
: To Be Determined

The idea of this session is to start slow… 
we start as slowly as necessary so that everyone can join in, 
and maybe we gradually get faster.

We will nominate a set of the month so we know what to practice.
Strive to learn the tunes by ear, 
but it's okay if you need to use "the dots" in the book or PDF!
We use sets of tunes from Comhaltas Foinn Seisiún. 

* Foinn Seisiún 1
  [CD](https://comhaltas.ie/product/foinn-seisiun-cd-1/),
  [Book](https://comhaltas.ie/product/foinn-seisiun-book-1/),
  [PDF](Foinn-SeisiunBook1.pdf)
* Foinn Seisiún 2

* Foinn Seisiún 3

Sometimes we'll play a tune through, 
discuss how we might play it better, 
and then give it another go;
it can make a difference. 
Generally we try to play the easier tunes in the first hour and start slow,
and then after a short break, 
we have another hour of the harder or faster tunes.

If you are an experienced musician, 
you are welcome to join us and work on ornaments, 
harmonies and variations.
We'll play each tune three to five times,
and the first time through a tune we stick to the basic tune,
so people have a chance to pick it up by ear.
