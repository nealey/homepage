It's difficult to rate this movie,
since it had to invent everything from just the books.
Some of the elements we associate with a James Bond movie
aren't present here:
the gadget is a geiger counter,
the evil weapon is bionic hands,
the henchman is just some jerk in a geology lab.

We were all confused about what the evil plot was:
we think Dr. No had a nuclear reactor on Crab Island,
to power a big radio transmitter that would take over a Mercury rocket.
Why? It wasn't clear.
They probably explained it, but we must have missed it.

I'm giving the opener for this high marks because it set the stage
for every subsequent film,
and because this was actually a believable spy-like scenario.
The "Three Blind Mice" was,
I expect,
both cute and thought-provoking to 1960s audiences.

Something else I noticed about this movie is that James Bond
prefers small objects: 
small guns, small cars.
Me too.

I'm still unsure what Dr. No was trying to accomplish, but his lair was 
really stylin', like he had Frank Lloyd Wright show up and design a cave
dwelling. The opening sequence was also very mid-century modern. What 
happened to the photographer chick anyway? He confiscated her negatives
and then sent her on her way, ok bye I guess.

Bond was pretty clever in a few situations. Felix shows up already. 
Honey Badger's seashells would be worth over $500 in today's money - I looked it up.

I guess this was a decent first outing for James Bond.

I almost fell asleep during the slow-moving nuclear reactor scene at the end.

Fine movie. The plot, villain, and girl were confused. The "dragon"
was neat, but made the island natives look dumb. Bond's hat trick was
cool, and Dr. No actually told us what SPECTRE stands for, which is
important in later movies. Bond had a cute little car and did neat spy
tricks in his hotel room.
