It's difficult to rate this movie,
since it had to invent everything from just the books.
Some of the elements we associate with a James Bond movie
aren't present here:
the gadget is a geiger counter,
the evil weapon is bionic hands,
the henchman is just some jerk in a geology lab.

We were all confused about what the evil plot was:
we think Dr. No had a nuclear reactor on Crab Island,
to power a big radio transmitter that would take over a Mercury rocket.
Why? It wasn't clear.
They probably explained it, but we must have missed it.

I'm giving the opener for this high marks because it set the stage
for every subsequent film,
and because this was actually a believable spy-like scenario.
