Okay, two movies in and we've got close-ups of scantily-clad ladies in
the title sequence!

That spy briefcase is cool as heck.

I don't know what it is about this movie, but I get such a strong
sense of place with it.  When they're in the water underground, I felt
like I knew how to get there and where everything was in relation to
them. The spy periscope is a cool touch.

The extended belly dancing scene spurred me to create a new
`male-gaze` rating. Immediately after, we saw the introduction of
colored teams, with two women (green vs red) fighting over who could
marry the chief's son. For the entertainment of the dinner guests, it
seems. We'll see color-identified teams again.

The fight scene was pretty believable, I found it edge-of-seat material.
And when the helicopter was chasing him, that was some actually scary stuntwork.

Rosa Klebb's dagger shoe might be my favorite henchman weapon of all time.
It's just so goofy watching the actress try to make it look threatening while pinned back by a chair.
But without the visual, it actually seems like a pretty scary spy weapon!

There were some decent zingers in this one!

He didn't have a car!

They should have let Matt Monro sing the title song all the way through.

I knew that we were going to watch this all week, and "From Russia with Love" has been playing in my head all week, so that's a 5. 

Rosa Klebb's poison knife boots are an instant classic, I'd give them a 10 if I could.

I agree with Neale, the stunt sequences actually looked dangerous to pull off- the Spectre helicopter and the boats-on-fire scene at the end, I was a little worried for the stuntmen.

Apparently I'm never going to get to go on the Orient Express and I'm a little bummed out about that. It costs (apparently) 30,000 euros. 

The sidekick from Istanbul that got killed off was the only person whose lines I could understand every time he spoke, so I was sad when he met his demise. Everyone needs to stop mumbling their lines. Or get better microphones.

Overall, this is still stands up as a pretty good Bond movie.

Hey do you think it's interesting that when we go back to Venice in a few decades in Casino Royale, we come back around to the theme of the Bond girl as a potential villian who might betray James Bum? Makes you go hmmmm.....
