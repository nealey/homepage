This one had some good quotes:

* "No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!"
* "What's that map doin' there?"

I remember this movie being better than it was. My favorite character of any James Bond movie is Oddjob and his hat, so he stole the show in my opinion. I liked Machine Gun Granny at the first evil base. I did not like Pussy Galore's name; I didn't like that James Bond sexually assaulted her and the woman at the beginning; and most of all I didn't like that he forgot to ask for vodka in his vodka martini, shaken not stirred. The plot was not interesting and neither were the characters. However, we did get a blue team vs. green team at the end, which I appreciated.

I gave every category a 5/5 except for one. This installment is engaging from start to finish!

Goldfinger really pulled out all of the stops on showing off his diorama, wow. The only thing that room was missing was floor sharks. Oddjob and his hat- the best evil weapon, and the best henchman. I love Pussy Galore's Piper Squadron- so cute!

Some plot hiccups: I'm not really sure what the point was in sending the guy off to get crushed in the car, only to bring the car block back? Why not just get rid of him in the moment- they all know he was going to get offed anyway. Oh well, I'm sure audiences gasped watching the non-existent guy get crushed inside the car at the wrecking yard.Â 

And Bond needs to get over being precious about avoiding running over Grannies with machine guns. That whole diversion dragged out the chase scene in Europe another 5 minutes, and it was very unnecessary.

Intimate partner violence: not impressive, didn't age well.

Do I want the male gaze to rate 5/5? I'm unsure if this should be a high or low rating.

This is probably in the top 2-3 Bond movies. It's a keeper!
