This one had some good quotes:

* "No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!"
* "What's that map doin' there?"

I remember this movie being better than it was. My favorite character of any James Bond movie is Oddjob and his hat, so he stole the show in my opinion. I liked Machine Gun Granny at the first evil base. I did not like Pussy Galore's name; I didn't like that James Bond sexually assaulted her and the woman at the beginning; and most of all I didn't like that he forgot to ask for vodka in his vodka martini, shaken not stirred. The plot was not interesting and neither were the characters. However, we did get a blue team vs. green team at the end, which I appreciated.

I gave every category a 5/5 except for one. This installment is engaging from start to finish!

Goldfinger really pulled out all of the stops on showing off his diorama, wow. The only thing that room was missing was floor sharks. Oddjob and his hat- the best evil weapon, and the best henchman. I love Pussy Galore's Piper Squadron- so cute!

Some plot hiccups: I'm not really sure what the point was in sending the guy off to get crushed in the car, only to bring the car block back? Why not just get rid of him in the moment- they all know he was going to get offed anyway. Oh well, I'm sure audiences gasped watching the non-existent guy get crushed inside the car at the wrecking yard.Â 

And Bond needs to get over being precious about avoiding running over Grannies with machine guns. That whole diversion dragged out the chase scene in Europe another 5 minutes, and it was very unnecessary.

Intimate partner violence: not impressive, didn't age well.

Do I want the male gaze to rate 5/5? I'm unsure if this should be a high or low rating.

This is probably in the top 2-3 Bond movies. It's a keeper!

It took me a week to write this, so my memory is already rusty.

I'm already tired of close-ups of lady bits with words on them.
I suppose it sets the tone, but it just seems uncreative.

I have mixed feelings about the title song! I know it's iconic,
but it's also not very good: "he loves gold, he just loves gold"?

The zingers here are top notch.
"No, Mister Bond, I expect you to die" is series-defining.

Pussy Galore really feels like an afterthought to me!
The whole story would have worked just as well without her,
she was just thrown in.

Weapons were ace. The industrial laser aimed at his crotch is great.
Odd Job's hat is another Bond-ism that will live forever.
Death by gilding is another.

This is the first movie where the car becomes a gadget,
and it's okay I guess. I don't even remember if he had any
other gadgets.

The evil plot would be excellent if nuclear chemistry actually
worked that way. Still pretty clever though.
And Goldfinger's evil lair is pretty good.
It looks evil, it's a lair, but it doesn't have the
panache that we saw in Dr. No.
