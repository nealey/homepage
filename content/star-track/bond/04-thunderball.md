The opening stunt sequence was ridiculous.
The jetpack is just goofy.
And the car has a thing that goes up to take bullets and not break the rear windshield.
It also squirts water out the back in case some people who can't move right or left are chasing you.

The opening scene has naked women for the first time!
And the opening title is still iconic but has less dumb lyrics!

This evil lair slays.
The evil villain has a white cat again!

Were torpedo bras a thing in the 60s?
Pussy Galore had one and so does this nurse.

I like that the back stretching machine has a torture setting.

Ooh, the bad guy gets gadgets in this one!

I had to ask the Internet for the plot. It was just too goofy for me
to get it. I couldn't understand how James Bond's medical spa happened
to be next door to a NATO base. Turns out I understood everything
fine, it's just silly.

The booty scene with Fiona Volpe was, I thought, kind of a nice step.
She made her own decisions.

I appreciate that Domino is always wearing black and white.
It makes it easier to distinguish her from all the other similar-looking ladies.
Bringing her the dog tags and watch was pretty clever.
So now there are two dead brothers: the original, and the SPECTRE face-swap one.
But he only needed to prove one of them was dead!

I also like how everybody on the Disco Volante (boat) wears that Disco
Volante T-shirt. I know it's cheesy, but making it easy to tell who's
who is actually pretty important for a complex plot like this with
mulitple actors. Amy and I like to joke about the Black Team and the
Orange Team, but that was a smart filmmaking decision.

The orange fart torpedo pack is really something.
Was that a callback to the brown fart jetback at the beginning?
If so, why bother?

I think I liked this one better than Goldfinger!

3 Fords and a Lincoln.

I remember the first time I saw it, I thought it was the crappiest one I'd ever seen.
