# S02E08: A Matter of Honor

## Riker and the Klingons

Riker gets sent to a Klingon ship to temp as first mate, but first he eats a bunch of disgusting things to prep for Klingon life.
Apparently Riker is really interested in the idea of his duty to kill the captain if needed. I don't remember much else.
