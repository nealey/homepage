# s02e01: Why is Wesley Driving the Ship

"The Child"

Deanna experiences some kind of immaculate conception via shiny light, and the previous doctor got a promotion so she's gone, but she left her kid to drive the ship apparently. Starfleet Academy is not required to become a pilot. Someone should tell that to Tom Paris.

# s02e02: Welcome to Digital Art of the late 80s

"Where Silence Has Lease"

![A terrible-looking composite of a green face in a star field](Nagilum.jpg)

I really thought this was going to be a Q episode, but instead it's just an ugly giant face floating in space that controls everything. I don't remember anything other than that, fell asleep.

# s02e03: Writers got bored again, back to the Holodeck

"Elementary, Dear Data"

Data tries out solving mysteries like Sherlock, but nobody is impressed because he doesn't actually solve them the way humans are used to. I think Jordy gets upset with him? I'm usually Team Jordy so he probably had good reason to get annoyed. The new doctor shows up to play dress-up with Moriarty, who evolves somehow into a good guy. Okie dokie.

# s02e04: Why not just do an episode about Betazoids

"The Outrageous Okona"

Dude shows up dressed like a pirate and wants to have affairs with the ladies. He likes Deanna I think? Some plot about space-based Romeo and Juliet and everything ends up fine without any need for mutual suicide. And pirate dude goes back to being a pirate. Pretty sure they were hoping he reminded everyone of Han Solo.

# s02e05: The 1980s realizes that deaf people exist

"Loud as a Whisper"

The chief negotiator in some sector is deaf and relies on telepathy and his chorus to communicate, also he knows ASL by the end of the episode? Data sucks at ASL, and I don't even know ASL. This guy is gonna tough out negotiations when his chorus gets killed off through hope and perseverance. 

# s02e06: More people hating on Data

"The Schitzoid Man"

The new doctor doesn't have a corner on that market anymore - now there's this guy, who's sick and honestly I don't remember much other than he really wasn't satisfied with how android development has gone. Apparently he ends up transferring his mind into Data by the end, must not have minded androids too much.

# s02e07: Questionable medical decisions and Potatoes O'Brien enters

"Unnatural Selection"

The doctor is just hell-bent on starting an epidemic in this episode. Thankfully, she's gonna be a sample of one in exposing herself to whatever is causing fast aging. I fell asleep before I saw the end, but apparently O'Brien does something with the transporter and reverses aging. I wonder if we get to see that trick again.

# s02e08: Riker and the Klingons

"A Matter of Honor"

Riker gets sent to a Klingon ship to temp as first mate, but first he eats a bunch of disgusting things to prep for Klingon life.
Apparently Riker is really interested in the idea of his duty to kill the captain if needed. I don't remember much else.

# s02e09: Data gets his arm pulled off by Riker

"The Measure of a Man"

This episode is either meant to show how wiley Capt Picard is in legal arguments, or we're supposed to get weirded out by Data getting pulled apart during a legal proceeding. Also Data apparently had "intimate relations" with that short-haired blond chick who was head of security last season but met her fate with the best villain in Star Trek, Armus. I'm going to try to talk a lot about Armus because everyone's already forgotten about him. I guess Data is actually a real man after all, thanks blond chick. 

# s02e10: Jordy has had about enough of Wesley

"The Dauphin"

More terrible computer graphics, which we get to see as Wesley's new love interest is actually a maroon Sasquatch type thing. It took us three tries to get through this episode, but we saw it through! Wesley was back to driving this ship again at the beginning. I guess whoever sits in that chair is how they tell us which character is important. Jordy tells Wesley to get the hell out of his engineering area because he's a serious pain in everyone's rear ends.
