# s03e01: Wesley's got a new 'do

"Evolution"

Man, I have to say, I feel for the teenage actor- getting to have your teenage acne documented on-screen sucks. But nice 'do, dude. Wesley's mom is back and he gripes to her about how he's an officer now? Did I catch that right? Did he like, skip going to the Academy? Starfleet just lets every 12 year old show up and do whatever they want, I guess. Anyway, I don't know what the heck else even happens, just enough to catch that Wesley's mommy also has a new short haircut.

# s03e02: Not a memorable episode

"The Ensigns of Command"

Sorry, pretty sure I fell asleep instantly. 

# s03e03: Another all-powerful demigod, seriously?

"The Survivors"

I slept through most of this episode, but I remember wondering why they were focusing on only two characters if the Next Gen crew was trying to save thousands of people on this planet. My husband filled me in though- one of the two characters was some kind of immortal dude and his wife was actually dead and he had created some kind of illusion. I am lodging an official protest about this episode I didn't actually watch- Star Trek does best if it creates stories that *could* feasibly happen if we stumble across a *lot* of alien civilizations at some point (and if Wesley is actually qualified to fly that ship of course). I'm kinda tired of the demigod subplots. Seems like a copout.

# s03e04: Swiss Vulcans and another review of the Prime Directive

"Who Watches the Watchers"

I actually liked this episode although Riker just looked...weird. Riker and Deanna dress up like Vulcans to fit into a culture that doesn't have any advanced technology yet, and the crew spends a lot more time arguing about the prime directive. The argument for breaking that rule is always that it's already been broken. Maybe they could come up with a different reason to break that rule, but hey - the guy from Twin Peaks is in the episode and there's a character called Palmer! That was a great, weird show. But anyway, the ancient Vulcans forgive the crew for messing with their culture and graciously agree that they should be left alone to evolve. Ok byeee!
