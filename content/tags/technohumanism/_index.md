title: Techno-Humanism
description: The societal impacts of technology
---

I came up with the term "Techno-Humanism" as a tag to describe how
humans interact with technology, how technology impacts culture, and
how we make decisions about when and where to implement technology.
I'm interested in human well-being, autonomy, and critical thought:
the things that make us human, and where that intersects with
technology.

Apparently this term already existed, and means something different to
whoever's trying to make it a thing. The Internet has a few articles
trying to define techno-humanism as the notion that technology is
wonderful and it's going to make humanity wonderful. Or something
along those lines. This is not what I mean by this term.
