<img alt="2012 Halloween Party Photo" src="images/dj-setup.jpg" class="right">

I run audio for the [Los Alamos Derby Dames](http://laderbydames.com/) at
their bouts and parties.  I have also, since 2008, run sound for various
[computing-related contests](http://dirtbags.net/ctf/). 
My mobile DJ setup includes:

* Two 15" powered speakers
* 12-foot light tree with 5 different light effects:
  * Chaser wash
  * LED Derby
  * LED Moonflower
  * Strobe
  * Disco ball
  * Laser
* Huge library of songs featuring:
  * Top 40 from 1970s through today
  * Club/House
  * Downtempo/Chill-out
  * Big Band (swing dance) music
  * Jazz (combo, hot, fusion, and more)
* Ability to play and mix music from any portable device (iPod, phone, etc.)
* Microphones: wired and wireless

I use a
[Stanton SCS.3](http://www.stantondj.com/stanton-controllers-systems/system3.html)
with [Mixxx](http://www.mixxx.org/): I am also
a code contributor to Mixxx.

I am solidly a wedding/party DJ.  I am more interested in your guests having
a good time than in being the center of attention.  I'm happy playing booty
rap, teen pop, salsa, 50s rock, bluegrass, line dances, or whatever else
your crowd likes.

I have about a year's worth of training from Toastmasters, and am happy to
perform Master of Ceremonies duties at your event.  I can also help you with
modest interior design: my focus is always on making a nice environment on
a tight budget.

To discuss availability and pricing, call the number on my card or [email
me](mailto:neale@woozle.org).
