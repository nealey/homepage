Title: DJ Service

<img alt="2012 Halloween Party Photo" src="images/dj-setup.jpg" class="right">

I run audio for the [Los Alamos Derby Dames](http://laderbydames.com/) at
their games and parties.  I have also, since 2008, run sound for various
[computing-related contests](http://dirtbags.net/ctf/). 
My mobile DJ setup includes:

* Two 15" powered speakers
* 18" powered subwoofer
* 12-foot light tree with:
  * Chaser wash (floods the dance floor with changing colors)
  * Derby (dancing spot lights on the floor)
  * Moonflower (changing spot lights on the floor)
  * Laser (hundreds of red and green moving light beams)
  * PAR cans (spot lights or colored columns of light on the walls)
  * Gobo (projects a single image, optionally rotating)
  * Strobe
* Huge library of songs featuring:
  * Top 40 from 1970s through today
  * Club/House
  * Downtempo/Chill-out
  * Big Band (swing dance) music
  * Jazz (combo, hot, fusion, and more)
* Ability to play and mix music from any portable device (iPod, phone, etc.)
* Microphones: wired and wireless

I use a
[Hercules DJ 4Set](http://www.hercules.com/us/DJ-Music/bdd/p/146/)
with
[Mixxx](http://www.mixxx.org/).
I am also a code contributor to Mixxx.

I am solidly a wedding/party DJ.
I want your guests to have a fun time,
dancing and singing along to the music they love.
I'm happy playing booty
rap, teen pop, salsa, 50s rock, bluegrass, line dances, or whatever else
your crowd likes.

I have about a year's worth of training from Toastmasters, and am happy to
perform Master of Ceremonies duties at your event.  I can also help you with
modest interior design: my focus is always on making a nice environment on
a tight budget.

To discuss availability and pricing, call the number on my card or [email
me](mailto:neale@woozle.org).
