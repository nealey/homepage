The Dink is (we think) a cross between a Chihuahua and a Norwich Terrier.  (A Chihuahua/Norwich Terrier mix, for all you Google searchers out there).  He is mellow for a small dog, but can get nervous like a Chihuahua when he goes for rides in the car (we don't drive much and he's not used to it).  He doesn't have any problem with the bike trailer, though:

His paperwork at the shelter said he was 4 months old in April, which would mean he was born in December of 2003.  But that's awfully close to Christmas, so the person surrendering him may have put down how long they had him, which would mean he was actually born in October, 2003.

When we got him he already knew "sit" and was mostly house-trained.  He's very friendly toward people and other dogs.  During his only encounter with a cat (so far) he was curious but not overly interested.
