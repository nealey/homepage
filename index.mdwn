I write computer programs.
When bad guys break into a computer,
I help figure out what they did.

I also teach people about programming and math.
You can find more about the teaching at
<http://dirtbags.net/>.

I walk or ride my bicycle most places I have to go.
For fun,
I build electronic gadgets with my daughter,
write silly poems,
and play guitar.
