Title: Going Brown

This is a journal--not a blog--initially about our effort to stop
generating so much trash.

In 2011 it's trendy to talk about "going green" for the benefit of the
earth, but anyone who's bothered to step outside has surely noticed that
earth is actually brown.  Hopefully, as we compost more and throw away
less, we'll be making more earth and less landfill.  We're going brown,
then, so that is the name of this journal.

This journal has no comments, although you are free to [email
us](mailto:neale-aim-journal@woozle.org) or talk to us in person about
anything you've read here.  Entries are in chronological order, just
like a book or a diary.
