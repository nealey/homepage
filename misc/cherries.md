title: Cherry Bombs Logo
---

I'm pretty excited about the new youth league starting up,
but since I can't skate,
I have to find ways to contribute from behind the scenes.
So I worked on another logo.

<img src="cherry-bombs.png" alt="Monochrome" style="background-color: #222">

This is for a junior (youth) league,
so it can't be too sexy or aggressive.
The font I used here is 
[Spray.ME](https://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/718516)
with an "O" modified to include a jammer star.

<img src="cherry-bombs-notext.png" alt="No text" style="background: url(paper.jpg)">

I wanted something kids could sketch easily and quickly,
on their faces or notebook covers or whatever.

It needed to work in a single color,
for cheaper T-shirt prints, temporary tatoos, stickers, and stuff.

<img src="cherry-bombs-stencil.png" alt="Stencil" style="background: url(cement.jpg) center right /cover">

Lastly, I wanted it to be easy to turn into a stencil,
for spray painting helmets,
cheeks, or whatever.
