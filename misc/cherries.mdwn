Title: Cherry Bombs Logo

![Cherry Bombs Logo](cherry-bombs.png)

This is for a junior (youth) league,
so it can't be too sexy or aggressive.

I wanted something kids could sketch easily and quickly,
on their faces or notebook covers or whatever.

It needed to work in a single color,
for cheaper T-shirt prints, temporary tatoos, stickers, and stuff.

![Stencil](cherry-bombs-stencil.png)

Lastly, I wanted it to be easy to turn into a stencil,
for spray painting helmets,
cheeks, or whatever.
