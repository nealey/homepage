Dear ministers of our Lord,

I am a minister of the Lord God who has been called to contact you
concerning a corporate fast that the Father God has led me to share with
you.

I have recently completed an 80 day fast (mostly water) on Oct. 30, in
which the Father shared with me that he wants His people in the Los
Alamos area to Fast and Pray and seek Him for His will and for you and
your congregations, as well as for what He wants to do in your life,
their lives and in the Northern New Mexico area.

He shared with me that the weekly Los Alamos City Wide Worship and
Prayer Group should advertise in the Los Alamos Monitor a corporate 10
day fast for all ministers of Father God.

Also, all Christians are also encouraged to join in the corporate
fast. This fast will begin Monday, and end Dec. 21.

We praise God we have now more than 10 individuals committed to doing
this fast.  We need all of you to join us in obeying Father God and
allowing Him to do as He has planned.

God is calling His church in this season to Fast and Pray.  He is also
calling her to consecrate and obey Him.
