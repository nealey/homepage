I enjoyed seeing the article "Los Alamos County Council Candidate Models Kilts" - click [here](http://www.ladailypost.com/content/los-alamos-county-council-candidate-models-kilts). 

I've been wearing kilts to work several days a week since August, and find them practical and comfortable. I get positive comments every time I wear one! 

Congratulations to Jaret McDonald on getting the modeling gig!
