When shopping in the frozen foods section at Smith's I'm sure everyone has noticed much of the LED lighting within the cases is turned off.
 
The overhead lighting reflects off the case and makes it difficult to read the labels. My own solution is simple. I just open the door. Works for me but I'd rather have the lights on.
 
Since LED lighting is advertised as lasting for tens of thousands of hours and since it's also very economical to operate, I asked one of Eric's (former store director) floor managers last year why some of the frozen food case lighting was always turned off. He said it cost too much money to keep lit all the time.
 
I might note that Smith's had a very good first year in Los Alamos grossing $70,000,000 I believe. Could you please keep those little LED's on? Please!
