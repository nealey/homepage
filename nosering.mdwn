[[meta title="Nose Ring"]]

There was this girl on the bus this morning with a nosering.  Well, not a ring per se, but a stud in her nose.  She had a very symmetrical face and the nose ring really accentuated that fact, so it was difficult not to stare at her.  Or, more poetically, I could have gazed at her visage for hours.  I think the poetic version would have been just as creepy as the other one, though.

It reminded me of when T got her nose pierced.  I think she was carpooling with Thom that day, and when he got to school and found me he asked if I'd seen her white or silver nose stud.  She had been quiet in the car on the way down, hoping he'd mention something, and he was quiet too, but more out of fear.  When she finally chimed up saying "well, do you notice anything?" he just stuttered "uh... no."

The reason he was so reticent to say anything was the same reason that I was.  What with the red swelling around the silver dot of a nosering, we both thought she had grown a little zit overnight.
