# Story 1: Honey, I shrunk Doctor Who

## S02E01: Planet of Giants

They're on Earth again, but they're tiny.
I bet it was fun building the sets for this one!

Pretty dorky but I'm enjoying it.
Why in the heck do they not bring flashlights with them, I wonder.

## S02E02: Dangerous Journey

"Anyway, you keep away from it," Ian said, just before walking over to
the pile of poisoned seeds he was referring to.

LOL giant hymenoptera.
Holy hell, Barbara faints!

I can't stop thinking about how much fun it must have been to
build this set!

## S02E03: Crisis

This is very cute.

Yeah, just store that giant poison seed next to Barbara,
who's suffering from poisoning.


# Story 2: Earth. Again. Also Daleks.

They go back to earth, and find a whole mess of Daleks.
