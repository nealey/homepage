[[!meta title="The 3-minute HTML tutorial"]]

<p>As computer formats go, HTML is really easy and logical.  It's all just
text that you can edit with any basic text editor, like gedit nder
Gnome, or notepad in Windows.  Let's start out with an example.  Say you
have a sentence, and you want one word in it to be bold.  That sentence
would look like this:</p>

<pre>Guess which word is &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt;?</pre>

<p>As should be obvious, the bold word in that sentence is "word".  Just
kidding, it's the word "bold", in between <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/b&gt;</code> tags.
The sentence will show up like so:</p>

<blockquote>Guess which word is <b>bold</b>?</blockquote>

<p>You now know HTML, the rest is just learning the names of the tags.</p>

<hr />

<p>Seriously!  Here's a slightly larger example:</p>

<pre>&lt;title&gt;My first web page&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Welcome&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Welcome to my &lt;b&gt;first ever&lt;/b&gt; web page!
  It features:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A title!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A header!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A paragraph!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An unordered list!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</pre>

<p>So what you end up with in the end is something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <div style="background: #ddd; border: solid black 3px;">
<div style="background: #00A; color: white; width: 100%;">
  My first web page - WoozWeb Browser
</div>
<h1 style="text-align: left;">Welcome</h1>
<p>
  Welcome to my <b>first ever</b> web page!
  It features:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A title!</li>
  <li>A header!</li>
  <li>A paragraph!</li>
  <li>An unordered list!</li>
</ul>
  </div>
</blockquote>

<p>The part inside the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> and the <code>&lt;/title&gt;</code> is the title of your
page; that's what goes in the window frame at the very top of your web
browser window, above the menus and everything else.</p>

<p>The stuff in between <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/h1&gt;</code> is a "level-1 header".  That
means that it's the biggest header you can get.  There are also h2, h3,
h4, h5, and h6 headers, with h6 being the smallest.</p>

<p>The stuff inside <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code> is a paragraph.  Since HTML treats
spaces the same as line breaks, you need to use paragraph tags around
each paragraph.  Inside the example paragraph is our old friend bold.</p>

<p>Then, there's <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/ul&gt;</code>, an "unordered list" (as opposed to an
ordered list, which would have a number by each item).  Inside the list
are four "list items", enclosed in <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/li&gt;</code>.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Now check this action out:</p>

<pre>&lt;p&gt;
This is an
&lt;img src="http://www.woozle.org/images/star.png"
  alt="star"&gt;&lt;/img&gt; image, and
&lt;a href="http://woozle.org/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is a link.
&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>

<p>Which will show up like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is an <img src="http://www.woozle.org/images/star.png" alt="star"> image, and <a href="http://woozle.org/">this</a> is a link.
</blockquote>

<p>The example above has an image tag, with two "attributes", "src" and
"alt".  The "src" attribute in an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag gives the
URL to a picture, and the "alt" attribute is the text that's displayed
to people who can't see images (blind users, folks without graphics
capabilities, or if there's a problem on your web server).  The "alt"
attribue is required, but you can set it to <code>""</code> if there's
nothing appropriate for alternate text.</p>

<p>Lastly, the infamous link, enclosed inside of <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>
and <code>&lt;/a&gt;</code>.  The "href" attribute gives the URL that
the browser will go to if you click the link.</p>

<hr/>

<p>That's it for basic HTML, and it should be enough to get you started
writing your own pages.  So go write something!  The best way to learn
it is to try stuff out and see what it does.  For more neat HTML tags,
