Title: Papers

These are papers I have written. Most of them were written to explain a
concept to someone on woozle.  Hopefully other people will find them
useful, too.

* ["Tank Tread" key-signing protocol](tank-tread.html)
* [Reply-To Munging Still Considered Harmful](reply-to-still-harmful.html)
* [Introduction to TCP Sockets](sockets.html)
* [3-Minute HTML Tutorial](html-tutorial.html)
* [How DNS Works](DNS.html)

---

The rest of these are old, and probably irrelevant, but I'm keeping them
here on the off chance that someone still needs the information.

* [Debian on the Digimatrix (2004)](digimatrix.html)
