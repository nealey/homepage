[[!meta title="Ode to the Bagel Girl"]]

We stand waiting for the 253 to Redmond  
The fog sits lightly on our tongues  
Cigarette smoke blending in

I walk to catch a glimpse of the bagel girl  
(who works the second shift,  
from noon to eight on weekdays).

Oh bagel girl, make me a cappucino.  
Brew the espresso dark and heavy  
Froth the milk thick and heady.

Tell me you love me, bagel girl.  
Ride away with me  
Into a cream cheese sunset.

I wrote this on the bus home.  There was a young girl with a beautiful
face sitting at the front of the bus, and I kept looking at her before I
started to write.  I was laughing so hard as I wrote this, that she
started to get pretty self-conscious.
