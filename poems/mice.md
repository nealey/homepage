title: Ode to Mice
---

Leave them mice alone  
Let them wander through your home  
Eat little holes into your walls  
Let them scamper up and down the halls

Leave them mice alone  
Let them grow up on their own  
Give them places for mousey beds  
Protect their little mousey heads

And sometimes late at night  
When you and your boyfriend had a fight  
Those little mouseys, they just might  
Not give a damn

But when you curl up in bed by yourself  
And you're hoping that somebody else  
Can feel your anguish, up there on the shelf  
They'll be eating SPAM

So leave them mice alone  
Leave them lots of styrofoam  
And sweaters, and pink insulation stuff  
Make sure that they have enough

Leave them mice alone  
Don't call the Orkin man on the phone  
Those little mouseys  
They are your friends
