This poem made for Wooz-Web 8  
So please download today.  
On my computer, it looks great!  
On yours, it might turn gray.

It uses ActivePoetry  
(By WoozleSoft, v4.3)  
And fonts from [here](#), and [here](#), and [here](#);  
Without those fonts, it sucks, I fear.

You'll need a 3-D graphics chip  
To see the verses do a flip;  
A hundred gigabytes of RAM  
(unless you want your mouse to jam)

Get MarcoMuddy SlickWave Bash  
If you don't want the rhymes to crash  
And please be sure to maximize  
So that the meter can resize.

I'm sorry if you cannot see  
This interactive poetry  
But I just cannot take the time  
To make my poems sound good on every browser!
