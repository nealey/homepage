Title: PARCC Testing

Well on Monday morning, I woke up  
And got my butt to school.  
Then the teacher told us that tomorr'  
We'd start somethin' pretty uncool.

[Chorus]  
Called PARCC testing!  
It's the stupidest test by far!  
It's a good thing they don't let school kids drive  
Or they'd run it down with a car!


So on Tuesday morning, I caught the bus  
And I walked right into class  
Then the teacher said "get comf'terble  
'cause you're spending the day on your bottom"

[Chorus]  
For PARCC testing!  
etc.

Then on Wednesday morning, I went in  
And sat down in my chair.  
It's a good thing it's just half a day  
Or I'd start pullin' out my hair

[Chorus]  
From PARCC testing!

And on Thursday morning, I sat down  
then started on the test  
I just couldn't wait 'till 3 O'clock  
when we'd finally get a rest

[Chorus]  
From PARCC testing!

Fin'ly Friday morning rolled around  
And the kids all went "hooray"  
Until teacher told us that next week  
We'd start the SBA

[Chorus]  
Oh PARCC testing!
