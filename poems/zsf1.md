Title: #zork Song Fight #1

HEY NERDS

Let's make some music.

The song is "Ballad of the Scorpion Queen and the Centipede King" and you
can [listen to it on YouTube](http://youtu.be/w2-EAsP2O1Q?t=52s).

SpaceHobo got ahold of the lyrics and changes:

* [Ukulele](http://zork.net/~nick/scorpion.pdf)


RULES

Hahahaha.

Probably put it in .ogg format 'cuz we're all big nerds like that.
You have to license it so that we can copy and listen to it.

Email your thingy (or a link to your thingy) to neale@woozle.org, 
and I'll keep a list of 'em here.
