This page is used to control what smileys are supported by the wiki.
Just write the text of a smiley to display it.

----

To change the supported smileys, just edit the lists on this page.
Note that the format is important; each list item should start with the
text that is turned into the smiley, escaped so that users can see what
produces it, followed by a [[ikiwiki/WikiLink]] to the image to display.

/!\ Bear in mind that the link to the image needs to be written in a way that
will work if it's copied to other pages on the wiki. So be sure to include the
smileys directory in the path to the file.
