Title: Eris HTTPd

Eris HTTPd is a small web server to be run from inetd or tcpserver
(tcpsvd in busybox).  It is based on
[fnord HTTPd](http://www.fefe.de/fnord/) but shares very little
code in common now.

I created eris for [Dirtbags CTF](http://dirtbags.net/ctf/), an
embedded build.  But it is also running woozle.org and many
other virtual hosts here.

Features
--------

* Actively maintained
* Small: around 1100 lines of code, 19k binary with glibc
* Fast: as fast as fnord
* Connection keepalive
* thttpd-style virtual domains
* IPv6 and SSL support
* CGI
* Content-Range
* Directory index generation


Differences with fnord
----------------------

* command-line arguments instead of compile-time defines
* eliminated use of libowfat
* no build dependency on dietlibc
* elimination of "old style symlink handling"
* elimination of user switching (you can use tcpserver -[ug])
* elimination of chroot code (you can use chroot)
* several bugfixes (sent to the fnord mail list)
