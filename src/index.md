Title: Software

I write software for a living. I like doing it so much that sometimes I
even write software just for fun.


Current Work
------------

* [Runit-Init](/neale/g.cgi/aur/runit-init/about/), an /sbin/init replacement based on busybox
* [Eris HTTPd](/neale/g.cgi/net/eris/about/), a small HTTP (web) server
* [9wm](9wm/), an emulation of the Plan 9 window manager
* [xss](/neale/g.cgi/x11/xss/about/), a suite of X screensaver programs


Not-So-Current Work
-------------------

* [Python IPQueue](ipqueue/), python bindings to Linux libipqueue. It was mentioned in a book and Google Scholar says it's been cited two other times, which makes me *Internet Famous* ðŸ˜Ž.
* [eguile](eguile/), like PHP but with Scheme instead. A fork of this is used in gnucash.
* [Woozle Scoreboard](http://woozle.org/scoreboard/), a browser-based roller derby scorebard
* [Hardware Scoreboard](/neale/g.cgi/derby/hw-scoreboard/about/), a microcontroller-based LED roller derby scoreboard
