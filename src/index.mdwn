Title: Software

I write software for a living. I like doing it so much that sometimes I
even write software just for fun.

My [version control](/~neale/gitweb.cgi), holds the source code to most
of these packages.

X11 things

* [xss](xss.html), a simple (suckless) screen saver for X11
* [dwm hacks](dwm/) contains my tweaks to [dwm](http://dwm.suckless.org/)
