Title: Universal Board Game Kit

What it is
----------

<a href="mine.jpg" class="figure"><img src="mine-sm.jpg" alt="My kit"></a>

The UBK is a collection of pieces and boards which allows you to play a number of board games with limited resources. This is perfect for people who like board games but don't have a lot of real estate or cash to devote to them: college students, people in tiny apartments, cheapskates, or just plain freaks.

Components
----------

Putting (most of) your existing board game pieces into a single
container is convenient and a good space-saver.  Many games consist of
merely a board, an instruction set, and a handful of pieces, in a very
large and otherwise useless box.  By using pieces you already own, most
people will find they already have all the pieces they need for every
game in the Universal Boardgame Kit.

* Pieces:
  * 10 each of 8 colors of gems. I used glass gems from a crafts
    store--cheap in bulk, but a gaming store might sell smaller
    quantities.
  * 8 6-sided dice. These can cost up to 50&cent;
    each, but you probably have other board games that can donate dice.
  * 2 colors of token sets (10 tokens per set). These can be cut out
    of a printed sheet, and glued to little wooden circles if you want
    more depth to them.
* Game boards


Boards we should add
--------------------

* [Farkle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farkle) (trivial)
* Cluedo
* Monopoly
* Chinese Checkers
* Reversi
* Mancala (just need an egg carton)
* Royal Game of Ur
* Pente
* Solitare
* Fox and Geese


How you can help
----------------

Make some boards! Design them however you want--I do mine by hand in
PostScript, but you can use whatever tools you'd like--and send me a
PDF file of the board and the source file: HTML, DIA, VISIO, Word, or
whatever you used to make it. If you can't generate PDF files or don't
know how to, email me and I can probably help you out.
