     pawns), each with 2 of 4 corners painted (for 6d2)

   * 64 coins:
     * 10 each of 6 colors (solid on one face, outline on the other)

     * 32 with chess peices on both sides (using 4 color sets).  These

     * 2 coins from each of the 4 color sets for chess have no emblem
     * 4 coins from the clue color set have no emblem

** Boards
   * If printed on paper, boards will be cheap and thin, so there's no
     need to go overboard trying to combine them.  However:

     * Chess, checkers, and Reversi all use an 8x8 grid, it may be
       possible to highlight the board for 9 mens morris and Ur
     * Pachisi and Clue may be able to use the same grid

   * Mancala may present problems, as it really plays better with cups
     (egg cartons would be perfect)
