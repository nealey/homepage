Created by Ralph Stevenson Jr and Charles Hargis in 2005 for the city's
tricentennial anniversary (1706-2006).  It is similar in design to the
[New Mexico tartan](nm.html), with a little less green, and white instead of
yellow, with a thicker center band.

[Bally Dun Celtic Treasures](http://www.ballydun.com/) sells this tartan.
