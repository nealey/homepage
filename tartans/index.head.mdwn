Title: Tartans

I like tartans, they appeal to my geeky need for symmetry and elegant
description.
  
<div class="figure">
  <img src="img/nmloe.png" alt="tartan image" />
  <br />
  <a href="nmloe.html">
    New Mexico Land Of Enchantment
  </a>
  <br />
  LG8 LV32 R4 G32 LG32 Y4 LG4
</div>

I've written a [tartan designer](design.cgi) that will take a sett
pattern in modified xtartan format, and output a PNG image of said
tartan. Below are some tartans I've made with it.

If you have one you'd like to contribute to my database, or would like
the code that generates this stuff, feel free to [email
me](mailto:neale-tartan@woozle.org).
