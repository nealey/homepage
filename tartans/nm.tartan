Name: New Mexico
Sett: R4 G24 B4 G16 B36 Y8 R4 Y4

Designed by Ralph Stevenson Jr, [officially recognized in 2003](nm-proc)
by the Secretary of State.  It is similar in design to the [Albuquerque
tartan](albuquerque).  I bought a scarf of this plaid from
Mr. Stevenson; it came with a photocopy of the tartan registration and a
few other documents.

[Bally Dun Celtic Treasures](http://www.ballydun.com/) sells this tartan.
