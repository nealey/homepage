I had to reverse-engineer this from the UK tartan registry.  If you
create an account with them, and request a sett, they'll email up to 5
per day to you.  I don't understand why a state's official tartan should
be so difficult to obtain: it seems like it ought to belong to the
people of that state and be easily accessed by them.

Well, here you go, people of Oregon.
