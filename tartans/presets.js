		"description": "Created by Ralph Stevenson Jr and Charles Hargis in 2005 for the city's tricentennial anniversary (1706-2006).  It is similar in design to the New Mexico tartan, with a little less green, and white instead of yellow, with a thicker center band."

		"description": "Wikipedia lists the sett as [Y/6] R4 MB26 K32 G4 W4 Lv4 W4 [G/44]. I'm not familiar with the [Color/Count] notation, the count appears to be doubled, possibly to indicate the total count of that thread in the mirror section.\n\nColorado house joint resolution 97-1016 makes this official but doesnt provide a thread count.  It speaks of \"cerulean blue\" which I approximate with the unique (669) color."

		"description": "This is an approximation of the pajamas I was wearing when I wrote the tartan designer.  They weren't actually a tartan.  I guess modern weavers feel they ought to show off the fact that they can do fancy tricks with their looms."

		"description": "Based off a jpeg at the Texas Scottish Heritage Society.  (Why did they save it as a jpeg?)  The first blue in their image was only 15 threads wide, I figured that was a typographical mistake given every subsequent blue was 16, even in the repeats.  According to the aforementioned web page, it was designed by June Prescott McRoberts, and adopted as the official state tartan on May 25, 1989."
