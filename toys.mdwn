Some various junk I've done.  Maybe you'll find it amusing.  Maybe
you'll just wonder why I spend so much time on this garbage.

* This [A Mind Forever Voyaging Decoder](amfv-decoder.cgi) is the sort
  of thing where you'll only know what it is if you have a need for it.
* Play [a fun game](fungame)!
* Or you could play [robotfindskitten](robotfindskitten.cgi), which is
  also fun!
* If you need to write someone a letter but really don't want to, try my
  [smalltalk generator](smalltalk.cgi).
* Maybe you'd rather see a [magic trick](omg-magic)?
* How about some [Internet Reiki](reiki)?
