This is a HTML5 doodad that makes a window with a solid color.

The intent here is to light up your face for video calls or photo shoots or whatever
else you need your face lit up for.

I wrote it after spending an embarassingly long amount of time trying to figure out
how to position a light over my webcam such that my chin would we well-lit too.
