Here is some various junk I've done.  Maybe you'll find it amusing.
Maybe you'll just wonder why I spend so much time on this garbage.

* [Starship Noise Generator](starship/)
* [Grep Dict](grepdict/) runs `grep` on `/usr/share/dict/words`; perfect for cheating on crossword puzzles
* If you need to write someone a letter but really don't want to, try my
  [social letter generator](letter.html)
* [Crunt](crunt.html)
