Title: Toys

Here is some various junk I've done.  Maybe you'll find it amusing.
Maybe you'll just wonder why I spend so much time on this garbage.

* Download my [presentation timer](timer.html) for use in any modern
  browser.
* If you need to write someone a letter but really don't want to, try my
  [smalltalk generator](smalltalk.cgi).
* Maybe you'd rather see a [magic trick](omg-magic.html)?
* How about some [Internet Reiki](reiki.html)?
* [Crunt](crunt.cgi).
