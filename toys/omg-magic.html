  Pick a card.  Stare at it long enough to memorize what card you've
  picked, try to burn it into you mind.  Don't worry, take your time,
  I'll wait.

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img alt="card" src="12.png" />
  <img alt="card" src="13.png" />
  <img alt="card" src="7.png" />

  Do you remember your card?  I'm going to yak at you for a little while
  to make you spend some time doing something other than focusing on
  those cards.  This is called <em>redirection</em> and it's a
  fundamental part of most magic tricks.  The fact that it works even in
  a web page says more about humanity than you in particular, so don't
  feel bad.
