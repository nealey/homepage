Title: OMG Magic!

This is a clever magic trick.  This paragraph should be filled with
suspenseful leadup to waste your time and get you TOTALLY PUMPED for
this AWESOME MAGIC TRICK that was created by some famous and/or mystical
person and now it's coming *directly to you* on the Internets!  Can you
believe it!


Pick a card.  Stare at it long enough to memorize what card you've
picked, try to burn it into you mind.  Don't worry, take your time, I'll
wait.

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img alt="card" src="cards/12.png" />
  <img alt="card" src="cards/13.png" />
  <img alt="card" src="cards/7.png" />
  <img alt="card" src="cards/10.png" />
  <img alt="card" src="cards/6.png" />
</div>

When you've memorized your card, you may <a href="#part2">proceed to
the next page</a>.

Do you remember your card?  I'm going to yak at you for a little while
to make you spend some time doing something other than focusing on those
cards.  This is called *redirection* and it's a fundamental part of most
magic tricks.  The fact that it works even in a web page says more about
humanity than you in particular, so don't feel bad.
